This modules allows to configure sysctl.

= Usage
  
  node "mynode" inherits ... {
    sysctl::value { "vm.nr_hugepages": value => "1583"}
  }

  When setting a key that contains multiple values, use a tab to separate the
  values:
  
  node "mynode" inherits ... {
    sysctl::value { 'net.ipv4.tcp_rmem':
        value => "4096\t131072\t131072",
    }
  }

  It is preferred that you set your exec path globally. This is usually done
  in site.pp and would look something like this (adjust for your environment):

  # Set a site-wide global path so we don't have to explicitly specify a path
  # for each exec.
  Exec { path => '/usr/bin:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/sbin' }
