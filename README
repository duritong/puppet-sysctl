This modules allows to configure sysctl.

= Usage
  
  node "mynode" inherits ... {
    sysctl::value { "vm.nr_hugepages": value => "1583"}
  }

  It is preferred that you set your exec path globally. This is usually done
  in site.pp and would look something like this (adjust for your environment):

  # Set a site-wide global path so we don't have to explicitly specify a path
  # for each exec.
  Exec { path => '/usr/bin:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/sbin' }
