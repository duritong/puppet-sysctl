= Overview

This modules allows to configure sysctl.

= Usage
  
  node "mynode" inherits ... {
    sysctl::value { "vm.nr_hugepages": value => "1583"}
  }

  When setting a key that contains multiple values, use a tab to separate the
  values:
  
  node "mynode" inherits ... {
    sysctl::value { 'net.ipv4.tcp_rmem':
        value => "4096\t131072\t131072",
    }
  }

  By default this module will only edit the configuration file, and not change
  any of the runtime values.  If you wish changes to be activated right away,
  you can do so with an exec like so:

  exec { 'load-sysctl':
    command => "/sbin/sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf",
    refreshonly => true
  }

  Set any changes you want to happen right away to notify this command, or you
  can set it as the default:

  Sysctl {
    notify => Exec['load-sysctl']
  }

  It is preferred that you set your exec path globally. This is usually done
  in site.pp and would look something like this (adjust for your environment):

  # Set a site-wide global path so we don't have to explicitly specify a path
  # for each exec.
  Exec { path => '/usr/bin:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/sbin' }
